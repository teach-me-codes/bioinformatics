  - Single-cell insights can inform precision agriculture practices by tailoring management strategies based on cellular responses to environmental factors, enabling precise interventions for optimizing plant growth, resource use efficiency, and stress management.

- **Genetically Modified Crop Development**:
  - Single-cell studies provide a foundation for precision genetic modifications in crops, facilitating the development of genetically modified varieties with enhanced traits, such as increased yield, nutritional content, and resilience to pests, diseases, and environmental stresses.

Through these applications, Single-cell Omics contributes significantly to understanding plant biology, enhancing crop productivity and sustainability, and revolutionizing agricultural practices for the future.
